# ClementoLang

ClementoLang is my hobby programming language. It is a concatenative language inspired by Forth, Porth and Kitten. It has static typing and it is designed to be functional.

## It is prod ready?

**NOOOOO!!!!** . I am doing this for fun and learning purposes. Do not use it in production. The syntax is still in flux and the implementation is not optimized for performance.

## Road

- [x] Static typing
- [ ] ADT (Algebraic data type)
- [ ] Type Classes
- [X] Compile
- [ ] Permissions system or use monads
- [ ] Create a proper documentation
- [ ] Better tooling
- [ ] Self-host
